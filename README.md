Key Considerations
1. Modularity: Separate concerns (data generation, anomaly detection, API logic) to ensure code reusability and clarity.
2. Command-Line Support: Scripts should be executable with parameters, suggesting a clear entry point and configuration management.
3. Docker-Compose Compatibility: Organize files to align with Dockerâ€™s best practices, including dependency management and environment configuration.
4. FastAPI Integration: Structure should support transitioning scripts into API endpoints without major refactoring.
5. PyTorch Model Training: Include a space for model artifacts (e.g., weights) and training utilities.
6. Scalability: Allow for future additions (e.g., tests, additional scripts, or models).
7. Configuration: Use configuration files or environment variables for flexibility.
